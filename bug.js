This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo with a large amount of data. The error message is not very descriptive, often showing a generic 'AsyncStorage has been deprecated' message, even though the code might not directly use deprecated APIs.  The issue is related to the internal limitations of AsyncStorage in handling large JSON objects or a large number of keys. The app might crash or become unresponsive, or data might be lost or corrupted.
